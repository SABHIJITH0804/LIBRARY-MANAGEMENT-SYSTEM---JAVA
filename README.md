# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM---JAVA
The Comprehensive Library Management System is a feature-rich software solution designed to facilitate various operations related to library management. With this system, users can seamlessly perform tasks such as adding books, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, and generating reports. The project extensively utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, multithreading, functions, and conditional statements to ensure efficient and robust functionality.

# Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The system implements classes for books, library members, and library staff with well-defined attributes and methods. Leveraging inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, the system models different types of books and library users, ensuring a flexible and scalable architecture.

Multithreading: The system incorporates multithreading to enable concurrent operations, allowing multiple library users to borrow or return books simultaneously. Multithreading is utilized to handle concurrent requests efficiently and ensure thread safety, enhancing the system's performance and responsiveness.

Through its user-friendly interface and robust architecture, the Comprehensive Library Management System offers a seamless and efficient solution for managing library resources and operations. This project serves as a valuable resource for learning and implementing advanced programming concepts in the context of real-worldÂ applications.
